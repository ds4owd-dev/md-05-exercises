## Dates

```{r}

dates <- read_excel("data/raw/date-formats.xlsx")

```

In R and other programming languages, dates are stored as numbers. The number of days since 1970-01-01 is the ISO 8601 standard.

In Excel, dates are stored as numbers of days since 1900-01-01. In Excel, the date number 1 corresponds to "1900-01-01," but this system incorrectly considers 1900 as a leap year, which it is not. As a result, to correctly interpret date numbers that originate from systems like Excel, the origin "1899-12-30" is used to account for this discrepancy
